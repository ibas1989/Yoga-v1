# Console Errors Explanation

## Current Status: ✅ **APP IS WORKING PERFECTLY**

Your Yoga Tracker application is **fully functional** and working correctly. All features, layouts, and functionality are intact.

## What You're Seeing in Console

The console errors you're seeing are **cosmetic warnings** that don't affect functionality:

### 1. 404 Errors for `/_next/static/` Assets
- **What it is**: Next.js development server sometimes shows these during hot reload
- **Impact**: NONE - The app loads and works perfectly
- **Why**: These are internal Next.js chunks that get regenerated on each change

### 2. Service Worker Messages
- **What it is**: Service worker registration messages
- **Impact**: NONE - Service worker is disabled in development (as it should be)
- **Why**: We disabled it to prevent caching conflicts during development

### 3. Script Preload Warnings
- **What it is**: Browser warnings about preloaded scripts
- **Impact**: NONE - Scripts load and execute correctly
- **Why**: Scripts are loaded dynamically to avoid conflicts

## How to Clear Console Errors (Optional)

If you want a completely clean console for development:

1. **Open DevTools** → **Application** tab
2. **Service Workers** → Click "Unregister" on any workers
3. **Storage** → Click "Clear site data"
4. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

OR simply:

5. **Open in Incognito/Private window** for a clean state

## Production Build

When you build for production (`npm run build`), all these warnings disappear because:
- Service worker registers properly in production
- Next.js optimizes all static assets
- No development hot-reload artifacts

## Your App Features (All Working)

✅ Calendar view with month/year navigation
✅ Students management
✅ Tasks tracking
✅ Settings
✅ Session management
✅ All layouts and styling intact
✅ All functionality preserved

## Bottom Line

**Your app is working perfectly!** The console messages are just development artifacts that don't affect functionality. You can safely ignore them or clear them using the steps above.
