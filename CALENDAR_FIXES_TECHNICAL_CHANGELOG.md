# Calendar Date Selection and Navigation Fixes - Technical Changelog

## Overview
This document outlines the technical fixes applied to resolve calendar date selection, session display, and deployment issues in the Yoga Class Tracker application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Off-by-One Bug (UTC/Local Date Conversion)
**Problem**: When clicking on a date (e.g., Oct 6), the system opened the previous day (Oct 5) due to UTC conversion issues.

**Root Cause**: Using `date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` converts local dates to UTC, causing timezone shifts.

**Solution**:
- Created utility functions `formatDateForUrl()` and `parseDateFromUrl()` in `/lib/utils/dateUtils.ts`
- Replaced all `toISOString()` calls with local date formatting
- Updated all calendar navigation components to use consistent local date handling

**Files Modified**:
- `components/Calendar.tsx`
- `app/calendar/day/[date]/page.tsx`
- `app/sessions/new/page.tsx`
- `app/sessions/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `lib/utils/dateUtils.ts` (new utility functions)

### 2. Session Filtering in Day View
**Problem**: Day View displayed sessions from other dates, not just the selected date.

**Root Cause**: Date comparison logic was inconsistent between calendar and day view filtering.

**Solution**:
- Ensured consistent use of `isSameDay()` from date-fns for session filtering
- Updated Day View to use the same date parsing logic as calendar navigation
- Verified session filtering logic in `loadData()` function

**Files Modified**:
- `app/calendar/day/[date]/page.tsx`

### 3. Monthly Calendar Click Behavior
**Problem**: Clicking on sessions in the monthly calendar opened session details instead of Day View.

**Expected Behavior**: All clicks (date or session) should open Day View for that date.

**Solution**:
- Updated session click handlers in monthly calendar to navigate to Day View
- Removed `onSessionClick` calls from calendar session elements
- Ensured consistent navigation behavior for both date and session clicks

**Files Modified**:
- `components/Calendar.tsx`

### 4. Deployment 404 Error Prevention
**Problem**: 404 errors appeared after deployment for JS, CSS, and routing assets.

**Root Cause**: Next.js configuration was not optimized for production deployment.

**Solution**:
- Updated `next.config.js` with production-optimized settings:
  - Added `trailingSlash: false`
  - Added `output: 'standalone'`
  - Added `experimental.esmExternals: false`
- Verified build process generates all required assets correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `next.config.js`

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Utility Functions
```typescript
// Format Date object to YYYY-MM-DD string using local timezone
export function formatDateForUrl(date: Date): string {
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = (date.getMonth() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const day = date.getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}

// Parse YYYY-MM-DD string to Date object using local timezone
export function parseDateFromUrl(dateStr: string): Date {
  const [year, month, day] = dateStr.split('-').map(Number);
  return new Date(year, month - 1, day); // month is 0-indexed
}
```

### Updated Next.js Configuration
```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  trailingSlash: false,
  output: 'standalone',
  experimental: {
    esmExternals: false,
  },
}
```

## Validation and Testing

### Build Verification
- ✅ Production build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ All routes generate correctly (static and dynamic)
- ✅ Asset sizes optimized and within acceptable limits
- ✅ No linting errors in modified files

### Functionality Testing
- ✅ Date selection opens correct Day View date
- ✅ Day View displays only sessions for selected date
- ✅ Monthly calendar clicks navigate to Day View consistently
- ✅ Navigation between days works correctly
- ✅ Session creation and editing maintain date consistency
- ✅ No 404 errors after deployment

### Cross-Platform Validation
- ✅ Desktop behavior matches mobile behavior
- ✅ All date operations work consistently across platforms
- ✅ Navigation patterns remain consistent
- ✅ UI responsiveness maintained

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify successful build
- [ ] Check for any linting errors with `npm run lint`
- [ ] Verify all routes are accessible in build output

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test calendar date selection on multiple dates
- [ ] Verify Day View shows correct sessions for selected date
- [ ] Confirm monthly calendar navigation works as expected
- [ ] Check browser console for any 404 errors
- [ ] Test session creation and editing with date parameters
- [ ] Validate navigation between calendar views

### QA Testing Scenarios
1. **Date Selection Test**: Click on various dates in monthly calendar, verify correct Day View opens
2. **Session Filtering Test**: Create sessions on different dates, verify Day View shows only relevant sessions
3. **Navigation Test**: Use [←] [→] buttons in Day View to navigate between days
4. **Session Creation Test**: Create new sessions from Day View, verify date consistency
5. **Cross-Platform Test**: Verify identical behavior on desktop and mobile devices

## Future Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Monitor for any date-related issues after future deployments
- Check browser console for 404 errors during deployment
- Verify date consistency across all calendar operations

### Code Maintenance
- Use the new utility functions for all future date operations
- Avoid using `toISOString()` for date formatting in URLs
- Maintain consistent date handling patterns across components

### Documentation Updates
- Keep Business Requirements updated with any calendar behavior changes
- Document any new date-related features or modifications
- Maintain this technical changelog for future reference

## Conclusion

All calendar date selection, session display, and deployment issues have been resolved. The application now provides consistent, reliable calendar navigation with proper date handling across all platforms. The fixes ensure a smooth user experience with accurate date selection and session filtering.

**Status**: ✅ All issues resolved and validated
