Description
I want a yoga classes tracker for instructors on web/mobile.

Student Balance Tracking:
    I want to track each student's balance. 
    This balance will be based on the number of sessions and the price per session for that moment in time. 
    The price per session should be customizable and as a global parameter which can be selected when inputting a student's balance. 
    The user should be able to fill in the balance in each session, but this is optional. 
    Also, the balance can be negative, meaning that if I don't enter a value in the balance, after I submit the session to be "closed", the students without a balance entered will be automatically deducted the default session price value for that particular time.
    The balance value should be represented as the number of sessions rather than currency.
    ✅ UPDATED: Balance display shows only numeric values (integer) without currency symbols. 

✅ IMPLEMENTED: Default Charge Settings

    ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Reusable BackButton component for maintainability and consistency

Entity Structure & Navigation (System Architecture):
    ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Entity Page Structure Standardization
        - All entities in the system follow a consistent page structure pattern
        - Each entity must have three dedicated page types:
            1. Create Page - For adding new records
            2. Details (View) Page - For displaying record information
            3. Update (Edit) Page - For modifying existing records
        
    ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Global Back Navigation
        - All entity pages (Create, Details, Edit) include a [← Back] button
        - The [← Back] button is consistently positioned in the top-left corner of each page
        - Button design features:
            * Left-aligned arrow icon (←) with "Back" text label
            * Ghost variant styling for minimal visual weight
            * Small size for compact header layout
            * Accessible on both desktop and mobile views
        
        Navigation Logic:
            - Primary behavior: Navigate to the previous page in browser history
            - Fallback behavior: If no navigation history exists, redirect to entity listing page
            - Smart routing prevents navigation loops and ensures users always have an exit path
            - Implemented as reusable <BackButton /> component for consistency
        
        Fallback Routes by Entity:
            - Session pages → Default fallback to "/" (home/calendar view) or use returnTo parameter
            - Student pages → Default fallback to "/?view=students" (Students Listing)
            - Session Edit page → Fallback to specific session details (/sessions/:id) or use returnTo parameter
            - Student Edit page → Fallback to specific student details (/students/:id)
        
        Technical Implementation:
            - Uses Next.js router.back() for standard navigation
            - Checks window.history.length to determine if back navigation is available
            - Custom BackButton component with configurable fallback routes
            - Preserves navigation context across all entity pages
            - Validated in all future deployments
    
        ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Enhanced Navigation Logic with Unsaved Changes Detection
    
        General Navigation Requirements:
            - Apply navigation logic consistently across all entities (Students, Sessions, and future entities)
            - [← Back] button must always navigate user back to the appropriate listing or originating page
            - If any unsaved data exists on current page, confirmation window appears asking user to confirm navigation
            - Navigation maintains consistency across all Student and Session related pages
        
        Student Entity Navigation:
            ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Student New Page (/students/new)
                - Page title: "New Student" (changed from "Create Student")
                - Cancel button removed from bottom of page
                - Create button moved to top bar (aligned right of title) and renamed to "Create"
                - Back button behavior:
                    * If user entered any information and clicks [← Back] → show confirmation window to discard unsaved changes
                    * If no data was entered → navigate directly to Students Listing page
                    * After successful creation and "Student Details" page opens, clicking [← Back] navigates to "Students Listing" (not to "New Student")
            
            ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Student Edit and Details Pages
                - If changes were made but not saved, show confirmation before leaving
                - If no unsaved changes → navigate back to Students Listing page
                - Maintain navigation consistency between all Student-related pages
        
        Session Entity Navigation:
            ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Session New Page (/sessions/new)
                - If user entered any information and clicks [← Back] → show confirmation window to discard unsaved changes
                - If no data was entered → navigate back to the originating page (e.g., Calendar, Day View) using returnTo parameter
                - After new Session is successfully created and user redirected to "Session Details" page, if user clicks [← Back], system navigates back to **the page where session creation started** (e.g., Day View, Calendar) using returnTo parameter
            
            ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Session Edit and Details Pages
                - If user made changes and didn't save → show confirmation before leaving
                - If no unsaved changes → navigate back to the originating page using returnTo parameter (e.g., Calendar, Day View, or Student Details if accessed from there)
        
        Technical Implementation:
            - Custom hasUnsavedChanges() function detects form modifications for each entity type
            - ConfirmationDialog component for user-friendly confirmation with consistent styling
            - State management for confirmation dialog visibility across all pages
            - Consistent styling and responsiveness across desktop and mobile
            - Smart navigation logic that preserves user's navigation context
    
    Navigation Patterns:
        ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Standardized navigation flow
            - After record creation → automatically navigate to Details page
            - After editing → return to updated Details page with refreshed data
            - Cancel operations → return to previous page without saving
            - Back button → intelligently returns to previous page with fallback protection
        
    Data Refresh Mechanism:
        ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Automatic data synchronization
            - All pages automatically load fresh data when navigated to
            - Edit pages fetch latest data before allowing modifications
            - Details pages refresh after returning from edit operations
            - No manual page reload required after any CRUD operation
        
    Routing Structure:
        ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Session Entity Routes
            - /sessions/new - Create new session
            - /sessions/:id - View session details
            - /sessions/:id/edit - Edit existing session
        
        ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Student Entity Routes
            - /students/new - Create new student (Enhanced with unsaved changes protection)
            - /students/:id - View student details
            - /students/:id/edit - Edit existing student
        
    Implementation Guidelines:
        - All future entities must follow this same structure
        - Navigation between pages uses Next.js router for seamless transitions
        - Component hierarchy should be consistent (e.g., CreateForm, DetailsView, EditForm)
        - Structure must be reviewed and validated during every deployment
        - Cross-entity navigation is supported (e.g., Session → Student → Session)
        - State preservation across navigation is maintained
        
    Benefits:
        - Improved user experience with predictable navigation patterns
        - Easier maintenance with consistent code structure
        - Better scalability for adding new entities
        - Clear separation of concerns between create, view, and edit operations
        - Prevents structural conflicts after deployment

    ✅ FIXED: Back Navigation Behavior (January 2025)
        - Student Create flow: After creating a student and viewing Student Details, [← Back] now navigates to Students Listing page
        - Session Create flow: After creating a session and viewing Session Details, [← Back] now navigates to the originating page (Day View, Calendar) using returnTo parameter
        - Student Details page: [← Back] button now navigates to Students Listing page instead of using browser history
        - Session Details page: [← Back] button now uses returnTo parameter to navigate to originating page

✅ FIXED: Student Addition to Sessions Bug
    - Issue: When adding students to sessions via "Add Student" button, selected students were not being added to the session attendees list
    - Root Cause: AddStudentDialog component was not receiving existingStudentIds prop, and handleStudentAdded function was not properly handling student ID parameter
    - Solution: 
        * Added existingStudentIds={selectedStudentIds} prop to AddStudentDialog in both New Session and Edit Session pages
        * Updated handleStudentAdded function to accept and handle studentId parameter
        * Ensured proper student selection and addition to session attendees
    - Behavior Confirmation:
        * ✅ Students can now be properly added to sessions from both "New Session" and "Edit Session" pages
        * ✅ Multiple students can be added in sequence without page refresh
        * ✅ No duplicate attendees can be added to the same session
        * ✅ Existing UI and styling preserved
        * ✅ Both "New Session" and "Edit Session" pages maintain consistent behavior

✅ FIXED: Complete Session Navigation Issue (Enhanced Fix)
    - Issue: When adding students from "Complete Session" dialog on mobile view, system was navigating to Session Details page instead of staying in Complete Session dialog
    - Root Cause: Nested dialog behavior with Radix UI Dialog primitives - when AddStudentDialog closed, it was triggering CompleteSessionDialog to close as well. Additional race conditions in callback timing were also identified.
    - Solution:
        * Modified CompleteSessionDialog onOpenChange handler to prevent closing when AddStudentDialog is open or when adding a student
        * Added isAddingStudent state to track student addition process and prevent premature dialog closing
        * Added conditional rendering for AddStudentDialog to ensure proper mount/unmount behavior
        * Increased AddStudentDialog z-index to z-[60] to ensure proper layering above CompleteSessionDialog
        * Added modal={true} prop to AddStudentDialog for proper modal behavior
        * Enhanced timing with setTimeout to prevent race conditions between callback execution and dialog closing
        * Added proper state management to prevent dialog closure during student addition process
    - Behavior Confirmation:
        * ✅ Users now stay in Complete Session dialog after adding a student
        * ✅ Multiple students can be added sequentially without losing context
        * ✅ Proper dialog layering with AddStudentDialog appearing above CompleteSessionDialog
        * ✅ Mobile view support with responsive w-[95vw] sizing
        * ✅ No side effects on existing functionality
        * ✅ Improved UX for session completion workflow
        * ✅ Enhanced robustness with additional state management and timing controls
