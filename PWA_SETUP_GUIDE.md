## üé® Customization

### Icons
The app currently uses generated SVG icons. To customize:

1. Replace the SVG files in `/public/` with your own PNG icons:
   - `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
   - `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)
   - `icon-192-maskable.png` (192x192 pixels, safe area)
   - `icon-512-maskable.png` (512x512 pixels, safe area)

2. Update the manifest.json if needed

### Screenshots
Add app screenshots to `/public/`:
- `screenshot-mobile.png` (390x844 pixels)
- `screenshot-desktop.png` (1280x720 pixels)

### Branding
Update the following in `manifest.json`:
- `name`: Full app name
- `short_name`: Short name for home screen
- `theme_color`: Your brand color
- `background_color`: Background color for splash screen

## üß™ Testing

### Test PWA Setup
Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
node scripts/test-pwa.js
```

### Test Installation
1. Deploy your app to a live server (localhost won't work for PWA testing)
2. Open on a mobile device
3. Test the install prompt
4. Verify offline functionality

### Test Offline Mode
1. Install the app on your device
2. Turn off internet connection
3. Open the app and verify it works offline
4. Turn internet back on and check sync functionality

## üìä PWA Checklist

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- Must be served over HTTPS
- Must have a valid SSL certificate
- Service worker must be served from the root domain

### Headers
The app includes proper PWA headers in `next.config.js`:
- Cache control for static assets
- Service worker permissions
- Security headers

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Installation Not Working
1. Ensure the app is served over HTTPS
2. Check that the manifest.json is accessible
3. Verify service worker is registering correctly
4. Check browser console for errors

### Offline Mode Issues
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check service worker registration
3. Verify cache strategy in service worker

### Icons Not Showing
1. Ensure icon files exist in `/public/`
2. Check icon paths in manifest.json
3. Verify icon file formats and sizes

## üì± App Store Considerations

While PWAs can't be submitted to app stores directly, they can be:
- Packaged using tools like PWA Builder
- Converted to native apps using Capacitor or Cordova
- Submitted to Microsoft Store (Windows 10/11)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Customize Icons**: Replace generated icons with your brand assets
2. **Add Screenshots**: Create app screenshots for better app store listings
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test on various devices and browsers
4. **Monitor Performance**: Use browser dev tools to monitor PWA performance
5. **Gather Feedback**: Get user feedback on the install experience

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues with the PWA setup:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Run the test script to verify setup
3. Ensure all requirements are met (HTTPS, valid manifest, etc.)
4. Test on different devices and browsers
