## üõ†Ô∏è Common 404 Error Fixes

- `/calendar/day/2025-10-20` - Day view

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Clean and rebuild
npm run clean
npm run build
```

### 404 Errors Persist
1. Check server logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all files were uploaded correctly
3. Ensure Next.js configuration is correct
4. Check if server supports dynamic routes

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
# Check the build output for large chunks

# Optimize images and assets
# Ensure proper caching headers
```

## üìÅ File Structure Verification

Ensure these files exist after deployment:
```
