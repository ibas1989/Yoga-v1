# Entity Page Structure Standardization - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Entity Page Structure Standardization implementation for the Yoga Class Tracker project. The implementation ensures consistent navigation patterns and data management across all entities in the system.

---

### 4️⃣ Cross-Entity Navigation

The implementation supports seamless navigation between entities:

1. **Session → Student:**
   - Session Details page displays clickable attendee cards
   - Clicking an attendee navigates to that Student's Details page

2. **Student → Session:**
   - Student Details page displays clickable session history rows
   - Clicking a session navigates to that Session's Details page

3. **List Views:**
   - Calendar view → Session Details
   - Student list view → Student Details

---

## 📊 Data Refresh Mechanism

All pages implement automatic data refresh:

1. **Details Pages:**
   - Use `useStudent` hook for Student Details (automatic real-time updates)
   - Fetch fresh session data on component mount for Session Details
   - Refresh data when navigating back from edit pages

2. **Edit Pages:**
   - Load latest data before allowing modifications
   - Navigate to Details page after save with refreshed data
   - Preserve unsaved changes when navigating away (future enhancement)

3. **Create Pages:**
   - Navigate to Details page after successful creation
   - Details page automatically loads the newly created record
